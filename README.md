Project Description 
The past year has transformed nearly every aspect of our world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has presented a challenge to public health, food systems, education, and the world of work. Education has been one of the most affected sectors by the COVID-19 pandemic which has led to the rise of e-learning whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. In order for education to be accessible at every student’s convenience, educational institutions have now been actively involved in the use of E-Learning Systems such as Google Classroom, Moodle, and Canvas so that they may deliver their courseware and other learning materials to their students.
As students of Information Technology, our team has come up with a Digital Learning System that will focus on providing an ease of access to contents, connectivity, and productivity to students. The system will be developed using C# and ASP.Net and will use a Database Management System. The project will follow the phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) starting from planning until testing. It will be a web-based system that will be used for handling course registration, upload and download learning materials. In addition to that, instructors will also be able to assign a task while students can view and manage all of their tasks using a task tracker, this will show the assigned task per course and will appear in order of its due date. It will also feature a login function for students and instructors, and a chat room that will let its participants send and receive a message.
What makes this system unique is that a note taking feature will be included where it allows users to type down important information while they are studying. Aside from that, a Pomodoro timer will also be included in the note taking feature in order to optimize one’s concentration, this will let the user adjust the focus and break timers to fit their workflow.
